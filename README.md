This personal project is an App that simulates space travel and orbital mechanics. The application calculates escape velocities, simulates rocket journeys between planets, and finds optimal transfer windows based on planetary orbits.

Features
Escape Velocity: Calculate the escape velocity for each planet in the solar system.

Rocket Journey Simulation: Simulate the travel of a rocket from one planet to another, including escape velocity calculations and travel time/distance.

Angular Positions: Calculate and display the angular position of planets after a specified time (in years and days).

Optimal Transfer Window: Find the best time to launch a rocket to minimize fuel usage, considering planetary positions and orbital mechanics.

Requirements
Python 3.7+

PyQt5 (for GUI)

NumPy (for mathematical calculations)
